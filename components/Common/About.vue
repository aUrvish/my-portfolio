      Experienced in Vue.js, I have worked extensively with state management
      libraries like <b>Pinia</b> and <b>Vuex</b> to build efficient, reactive
      applications. Iâ€™ve implemented dynamic routing and seamless page
      transitions using <b>Vue Router</b>, enhancing the overall navigation
      flow. My front-end development skills include crafting clean, responsive
      user interfaces with <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, <b>SCSS</b>, and
      <b>Bootstrap</b>. I focus on writing modular, maintainable code that
      supports fast and intuitive user experiences. Additionally, Iâ€™ve developed
      dynamic UI components that significantly boost app interactivity and
      usability.

      I have a solid grasp of Laravel, enabling me to build secure
      <b>RESTful APIs</b> and robust backend systems. My experience includes
      integrating <b>Laravel Livewire</b> to create dynamic, reactive components
      without relying heavily on JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked with
      <b>Laravel Nova</b> to design powerful admin dashboards and manage
      resources efficiently. For real-time functionality, Iâ€™ve utilized
      <b>Laravel WebSockets</b>, and Iâ€™ve also implemented
      <b>Laravel Tenancy</b> to support scalable multi-tenant architectures. I'm
      proficient in <b>MySQL</b>, handling complex data relationships and
      performance optimizations. Additionally, Iâ€™m well-versed in Laravelâ€™s
      background jobs, queues, and task scheduling to ensure smooth automation
      and improved application performance.

        In terms of deployment and server management, I have hands-on experience
        with setting up and maintaining production environments using
        <b>Ubuntu</b>, <b>AWS</b>, <b>DigitalOcean</b>, and
        <b>Laravel Forge</b>. Iâ€™ve configured <b>Nginx</b>, <b>Apache</b>,
        managed <b>SSL certificates</b>, and optimized server settings to ensure
        secure and efficient application performance. My deployment workflow
        includes utilizing <b>Git</b> for version control, automating
        deployments with CI/CD pipelines and performing routine server
        monitoring and maintenance. This experience has allowed me to
        confidently launch and manage scalable, high-availability web
        applications in real-world environments.
