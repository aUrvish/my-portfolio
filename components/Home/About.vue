        Experienced in Vue.js, I have worked extensively with state management
        libraries like <b>Pinia</b> and <b>Vuex</b> to build efficient, reactive
        applications. Iâ€™ve implemented dynamic routing and seamless page
        transitions using <b>Vue Router</b>, enhancing the overall navigation
        flow. My front-end development skills include crafting clean, responsive
        user interfaces with <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, <b>SCSS</b>, and
        <b>Bootstrap</b>. I focus on writing modular, maintainable code that
        supports fast and intuitive user experiences. Additionally, Iâ€™ve
        developed dynamic UI components that significantly boost app
        interactivity and usability.

        I have a solid grasp of Laravel, enabling me to build secure
        <b>RESTful APIs</b> and robust backend systems. My experience includes
        integrating <b>Laravel Livewire</b> to create dynamic, reactive
        components without relying heavily on JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked with
        <b>Laravel Nova</b> to design powerful admin dashboards and manage
        resources efficiently. For real-time functionality, Iâ€™ve utilized
        <b>Laravel WebSockets</b>, and Iâ€™ve also implemented
        <b>Laravel Tenancy</b> to support scalable multi-tenant architectures.
        I'm proficient in <b>MySQL</b>, handling complex data relationships and
        performance optimizations. Additionally, Iâ€™m well-versed in Laravelâ€™s
        background jobs, queues, and task scheduling to ensure smooth automation
        and improved application performance.
